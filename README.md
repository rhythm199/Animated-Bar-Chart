# Bar Animation Test

## Overview

This is a simple web application that demonstrates a bar animation effect. The bars fluctuate in height using CSS animations, with controls to start, stop, and reset the animation. The application includes three buttons: **Start**, **Stop**, and **Reset** to control the behavior of the bars.

This project was created as part of an assignment for a company to test skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## File Structure

Since the project is implemented in a single `.html` file, the structure is as follows:

- **HTML**: Defines the structure of the bars and buttons.  
- **CSS**: Embedded in the `<style>` tag, it includes styles for layout and animations.  
- **JavaScript**: Embedded in the `<script>` tag, it handles the animation logic for the buttons.

## Customization

You can make the following changes to customize the project:

- Modify the **colors** of the bars in the CSS.  
- Adjust the **animation speed** or **height variations** by editing the `@keyframes` section.  
- Change the layout of the buttons or the size of the container by altering CSS styles.
